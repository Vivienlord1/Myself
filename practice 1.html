            <h1>A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
            <p>
            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
            </p> 
            <p>
            I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
            </p>

            I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books.
            </p>
            <p id="secondHeader">
            I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind.
            Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing.
            But my dream is still alive.
